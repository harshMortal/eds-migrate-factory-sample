    <p>When it comes to migraine prevention, you have options. See how QULIPTA and topiramate compare. Talk to your doctor about what's right for you.</p>
    <p>QULIPTA is approved for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults.</p>
    <p>Topiramate is approved for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults and adolescents 12 years and older. It was initially approved to treat certain types of seizures.</p>
    <p>QULIPTA is an oral pill taken once daily.</p>
    <p>Topiramate is an oral pill taken twice daily.</p>
    <p>QULIPTA blocks a protein called CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide), which is believed to play a key role in migraine attacks.</p>
    <p>Topiramate is believed to calm brain activity in multiple ways. The exact way topiramate works in migraine is not fully understood.</p>

    <h2>RESULTS FROM A HEAD-TO-HEAD STUDY:
QULIPTA VS TOPIRAMATE</h2>
    <p>Study Design:</p>
    <p>A 24-week study conducted outside of the US of 545 adult patients compared QULIPTA and topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine. Participants had a history of at least 4 monthly migraine days, had to be eligible for preventive migraine treatment, and could not have taken topiramate or QULIPTA in the past.</p>
    <p>Patients took either QULIPTA 60 mg per day or topiramate 50 mg, 75 mg or 100 mg per day and didn't know which medicine they were taking. For patients taking topiramate, they started at 25 mg per day and the dose was slowly increased over 6 weeks until they reached the highest dose they could tolerate of 50 mg, 75 mg or 100 mg per day divided in two doses.</p>
    <p>Overall conclusions comparing two prescription medicines cannot be made on a single clinical trial alone.</p>
