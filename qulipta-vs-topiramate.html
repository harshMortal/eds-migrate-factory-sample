Participants had a history of at least 4 monthly migraine days, had to be eligible for preventive migraine treatment, and could not have taken topiramate or QULIPTA in the past.

Patients took either QULIPTA 60 mg per day or topiramate 50 mg, 75 mg or 100 mg per day and didn't know which medicine they were taking. For patients taking topiramate, they started at 25 mg per day and the dose was slowly increased over 6 weeks until they reached the highest dose they could tolerate of 50 mg, 75 mg or 100 mg per day divided in two doses.</p>
