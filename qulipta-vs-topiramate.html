    <h2>KNOW THE
DIFFERENCE</h2>
    <p>When it comes to migraine prevention, you have options. See how QULIPTA and topiramate compare. Talk to your doctor about what's right for you.

QULIPTA is approved for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults.

Topiramate is approved for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults and adolescents 12 years and older. It was initially approved to treat certain types of seizures.

QULIPTA is an oral pill taken once daily.

Topiramate is an oral pill taken twice daily.

QULIPTA blocks a protein called CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide), which is believed to play a key role in migraine attacks.

Topiramate is believed to calm brain activity in multiple ways. The exact way topiramate works in migraine is not fully understood.</p>

    <p>Measured using the Patient Satisfaction with Study Medication scale which asks a single question with 7 response options ranging from "extremely satisfied" to "extremely dissatisfied"

Based on how this study was designed, Patient Satisfaction findings are less certain. Not all patients in the study provided a response. Data presented here were the data available at Week 24.

It is important to talk to your doctor about all the benefits and risks of each treatment option.</p>
